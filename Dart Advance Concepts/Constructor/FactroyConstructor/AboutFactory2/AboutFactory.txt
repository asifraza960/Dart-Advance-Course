The key idea behind factory constructors in Dart is to provide more control over object creation compared to generative constructors (the default constructors). In a generative constructor, every time you create an object using new or by directly invoking the class, you get a new instance. However, with factory constructors, you can decide whether to return a new instance, return an existing cached instance, or even return an instance of a subclass.
