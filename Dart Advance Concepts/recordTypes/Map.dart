// Map

{"key": subpattern1, someConst: subpattern2}

// Map patterns match values that implement Map, and then recursively match its subpatterns against the map's keys to destructure them.

// Map patterns don't require the pattern to match the entire map. A map pattern ignores any keys that the map contains that aren't matched by the pattern.
