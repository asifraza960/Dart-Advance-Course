Conclusion:
Using isolates in Flutter enables you to keep your app responsive, especially when dealing with:

Heavy computations (data parsing, file processing, etc.).
Complex image processing.
API requests with large datasets.
Long-running tasks like database queries or file compression.
By using isolates, you prevent blocking the main UI thread, ensuring your Flutter apps remain smooth and responsive, even with complex tasks running in the background.
