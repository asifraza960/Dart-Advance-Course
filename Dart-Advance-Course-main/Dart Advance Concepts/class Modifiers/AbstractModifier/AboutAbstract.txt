==> abstract
To define a class that doesn't require a full, concrete implementation of its entire interface, use the abstract modifier.

Abstract classes cannot be constructed from any library, whether its own or an outside library. Abstract classes often have abstract methods.

==> a.dart

abstract class Vehicle {
  void moveForward(int meters);
}



==> b.dart

import 'a.dart';

// Error: Can't be constructed.
Vehicle myVehicle = Vehicle();

// Can be extended.
class Car extends Vehicle {
  int passengers = 4;

  @override
  void moveForward(int meters) {
    // ...
  }
}

// Can be implemented.
class MockVehicle implements Vehicle {
  @override
  void moveForward(int meters) {
    // ...
  }
}

// ager ap apni class  k sath abstract ka keyword lagaty hian to ap outside the side the class uss ka object ni bna skty but uss ko extends or implements kr skty hian


If you want your abstract class to appear to be instantiable, define a factory constructor.
